## Task

### Get Started

#### Install dependencies and start workspace

```sh
yarn && yarn dev
```

### Set up your CSS files

- Set up your `Button.styles.css` file for styles.
- Use Tailwind to generate utility classes for your components.

### Create a button component

From the following Figma designs, create a button component using Storybook, React, Tailwind & Jest
https://www.figma.com/file/6IsaMLS5RdQhI8DnC9H94J/Tech-Test-System

- The button styles should be defined using Tailwind CSS
- Use Tailwind component classes to create .button classes for the different variants following BEM methodology.
- The button should have a loading state.
- The button should have the ability to add an icon.
- The button should have the ability to be disabled.

### Set up testing with Jest

**Create three tests for the Button component.**

- One test should be to test the button in a disabled state, to ensure it doesn't run any action.
- The second test should be to check the loading state of the button.
- Come up with a third test for the button, which you feel would be useful.

### Showcase your button in Storybook

- Create a `Button.stories.tsx` file
- Showcase several use cases for your button component
